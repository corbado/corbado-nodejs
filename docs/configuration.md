# Configuration

The Corbado Node.js SDK uses a configuration object to manage various settings. This object is created using the `Config` class, which takes two parameters: `projectID` and `apiSecret`.

## Creating a Configuration Object

Here is an example of how to create a configuration object:

```javascript
import { Config } from '@corbado/node-sdk';

const projectID = process.env.CORBADO_PROJECT_ID;
const apiSecret = process.env.CORBADO_API_SECRET;

const config = new Config(projectID, apiSecret);
```

## Validation in Config Class

The `Config` class validates the `projectID` and `apiSecret` parameters. The `projectID` must start with 'pro-', and the `apiSecret` must start with 'corbado1'. If these conditions are not met, an error is thrown.

## Config Class Properties

The `Config` class also sets several other properties:

- `BackendAPI`: The base URL for the backend API. By default, this is set to `https://backendapi.corbado.io`.
- `FrontendAPI`: The base URL for the frontend API. This is generated by replacing [projectID] in the default frontend API URL with the provided projectID.
- `ShortSessionCookieName`: The name of the short session cookie. By default, this is set to `cbo_short_session`.
- `CacheMaxAge`: The maximum age for the cache. By default, this is set to 60000 milliseconds (1 minute).
- `JWTIssuer`: The issuer for the JWT. This is generated by appending `/.well-known/jwks` to the FrontendAPI.
  These properties are used throughout the SDK to configure various services. For example, the `BackendAPI`, `projectID`, and `apiSecret` are used to create an Axios client in the SDK class.

### Environment Variables

Remember to set the `CORBADO_PROJECT_ID` and `CORBADO_API_SECRET` environment variables in your project. These are used to create the `Config` object.
